      "message": "Hi Xiaobo,\nI have a slightly different solution for this in master. I will see if I can adapt it to R.\n\nHere\u0027s the patch:\n\nFrom f56b2692626c68df4632dacfc8834640594d437f Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001\nFrom: Siarhei Vishniakou \u003csvv@google.com\u003e\nDate: Tue, 08 Sep 2020 19:43:33 -0500\nSubject: [PATCH] Check for focused window before raising \u0027no focused window\u0027 ANR\n\nPreviously, we were relying on the dispatcher trying to send a focused\nevent prior to raising ANR due to no focused window.\n\nSo, the previous expected behavior was:\n1. A key comes in, and there is no focused window\n2. ANR timer starts\n3. Focused window appears\n4. We try to dispatch the key again, and realize there\u0027s a focused\nwindow\n5. We stop the ANR timer\n\nHowever, there are cases when the pending key event gets dropped. For\nexample, this could happen if the user touches another application. That\nwould lead to the following sequence of events:\n1. A key comes in, and there is no focused window\n2. ANR timer starts\n3. User touches another application, and the pending key gets dropped\n4. Focused window appears\n5. We don\u0027t try to dispatch the pending key anymore (since nothing is\npending)\n6. We raise the \"no focused window\" ANR, even though we have a focused\nwindow (and don\u0027t even have a focused event to dispatch anymore).\n\nSolution: always check for focused window presence before raising the\n\"no focused window\" ANR. This way, we will no longer rely on other events\nhappening for this ANR to be functioning correctly.\n\nBug: 164754075\nTest: atest inputflinger_tests\nChange-Id: I70162d507fa7d65132c83fcba96ad9931e373647\n---\n\ndiff --git a/services/inputflinger/dispatcher/InputDispatcher.cpp b/services/inputflinger/dispatcher/InputDispatcher.cpp\nindex efe2bb1..0f06ddf 100644\n--- a/services/inputflinger/dispatcher/InputDispatcher.cpp\n+++ b/services/inputflinger/dispatcher/InputDispatcher.cpp\n@@ -481,6 +481,33 @@\n }\n \n /**\n+ * Raise ANR if there is no focused window.\n+ * Before the ANR is raised, do a final state check:\n+ * 1.
