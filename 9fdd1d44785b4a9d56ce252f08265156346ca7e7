      "message": "RFC: Hi Steven, this is still a quick draft. However, I would appreciate some early comments, specially on:\n * Is IPCThreadSate the appropriate area to add this support?\n * Is after a failure to talkWithDriver a good place to pull the error?\n * It seems I need to whitelist this ioctl in somewhere in a selinux policy file?\n\nNote: I\u0027ll add some tests along with the patch later on today.",
