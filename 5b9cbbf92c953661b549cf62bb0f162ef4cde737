The API cut is made here because we want to use part of libbinder and it\u0027s hard to extract, but are permissions API usages so hard to cut out? For instance, these libraries can\u0027t be used for dependency injection because we don\u0027t support something like setDefaultServiceManager for these.

RPC Binder uses RpcServer/RpcSession.\n\n\u003e I assume the recommendation is to mock\n\nThe best place to do dependency injection would depend on the exact architecture. For fuzzing V1, I would recommend to return \u0027new BBinder()\u0027 or the Default class from the service manager. Then, follow-up with something more fleshed out to increase coverage. That is, recommend vertical integration before spending too much time trying to mock services (this can get arbitrarily difficult). Though, essentially, yes, mock the services.",

We have half of this picture, since we deal in service interfaces to decouple from implementation.
