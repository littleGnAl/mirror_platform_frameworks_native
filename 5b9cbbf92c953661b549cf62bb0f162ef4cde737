The API cut is made here because we want to use part of libbinder and it\u0027s hard to extract, but are permissions API usages so hard to cut out? For instance, these libraries can\u0027t be used for dependency injection because we don\u0027t support something like setDefaultServiceManager for these.

RPC Binder uses RpcServer/RpcSession.\n\n\u003e I assume the recommendation is to mock\n\nThe best place to do dependency injection would depend on the exact architecture. For fuzzing V1, I would recommend to return \u0027new BBinder()\u0027 or the Default class from the service manager. Then, follow-up with something more fleshed out to increase coverage. That is, recommend vertical integration before spending too much time trying to mock services (this can get arbitrarily difficult). Though, essentially, yes, mock the services.",

We have half of this picture, since we deal in service interfaces to decouple from implementation. The half we are missing is in (many) instances, we request the interface from the service manager in ctors. Either we inject within the service manager, or we decouple, and provide a mocked interface for testing (especially) on host.\n\u003e Returning false or null or a value means that we are saying we know a priori what all clients might like to do here.\nIt looks like the code I was looking at (BatteryService) actually does this (see the CL).\n\u003e I would like to see a case established before we expose things here\nThe case is moving more testing/fuzzing to host available since these tests are automatically exercised on pre-submit and are (essentially) free from an infra cost perspective.\n\nIn any case, the CL above is the motivating code for these changes -- with the aim of making more of our owned code host available.",
