Yes, by closing the read-end of the pipe you definitely unblock the thread, on the other hand there\u0027s now no guarantee at all that you read any or all of the data the remote wants to write. The proper fix is still to figure out why the remote is holding on to the write-end of the pipe (or a clone of it rather).",
